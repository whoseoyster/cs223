I discussed my solution with: nobody.

*A brief discussion of the major difficulties encountered*

My old log file is no longer in my CS223 file on the zoo network!
And it was accidentally overwritten on my local machine, and I
am unable to retrieve it using the command:
% /c/cs223/bin/retrieve  1  time_log.txt

Therefore, this is my extra time_log, without the previous log data.
