I discussed my solution with: nobody.

*A brief discussion of the major difficulties encountered*

The toughest part of this homework was to get the algorithms working correctly. Implementing the heaps was relatively straightforward, especially with guidance from Prof. Slade's notes. Placing the rooms into a dictionary was not very challenging, but understanding what to assign their keys in the three algorithms was tricky for me. Keeping the print statements appropriately loud or muted was just a matter of trial and error with Firex. Freeing memory for the rooms gave me a bit of trouble, as I was not entirely sure why a room needed to be freed anywhere outside of deletemin in the heap. Making sure that there were no rooms with neighbors not in the dictionary was a little bit frustrating, because I wasn't able to loop through the dictionary correctly at first.
