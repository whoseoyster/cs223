I discussed my solution with: nobody.

*A brief discussion of the major difficulties encountered*

It was difficult to fully understand how to build a hash table with linked lists. Once this was understood,
everything became much easier. The Valgrind memory allocation errors were slightly cumbersome to debug properly.
Iterating through all possible combinations when the input argument was a number was also challenging. Once I 
figured out how to do this, it was easy to implement the HashSearch method on each word to check whether the dictionary
contained it. Adding only the words that were the same length of the input from the dictionary to the hash table was
also a bit difficult to get right, since each word was actually a line and contained an extra \n character.
A few minor issues on how to initialize variables properly, when to pass pointers instead of the values and things like
this posed challenges, but were easier to overcome just with trial and error.
