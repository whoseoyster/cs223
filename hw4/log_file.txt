I discussed my solution with: nobody.

*A brief discussion of the major difficulties encountered*

The toughest part of this homework was to get the program to fail gracefully. In many instances,
I was unnecessarily allocating memory for tokens -- valgrind would throw memory loss errors. Another difficulty was with strdup and its own memory. Correcting StackDestroy took some effort, because I was not sure what exactly needed to be freed on each occasion. The actual implementation of the shunting yard algorithm (for which I used an extra stack -- the output buffer held the complete RPN array) and the calculation using RPN was very straightforward. Most issues definitely arose from memory loss and string duplication.
