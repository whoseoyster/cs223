I discussed my solution with: nobody.

*A brief discussion of the major difficulties encountered*

The toughest part of this homework was to get the dynamic programming solution to work well. Intuitively,
getting the pseudo-code version of the algorithm implemented in a matrix was not very easy. Recursively
printing the words from the dynamic programming solution was also giving me a few errors initially.
For the hash table, reading the input file was tricky at first, but eventually worked out fine. This
problem set was relatively easier than the others, as we didn't have to implement our own data structures
and their specific algorithms. No memory leak issues also. Knowing that our dynamic programming solution did
not need to look exactly like the staff solution's was also a relief.
